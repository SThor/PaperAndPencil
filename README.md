A Processing library for creating paper textures and pencil-like drawing effects. It simulates natural drawing techniques through various methods that add randomness and imperfection to standard geometric shapes.

## Features

- Paper texture generation with customizable properties
- Pencil-like drawing effects with natural variation
- Support for basic shapes:
  - Lines with natural pencil stroke appearance
  - Circles and arcs with sketchy effects
  - Filled shapes with pencil-like textures
- Print mode for high-quality output
